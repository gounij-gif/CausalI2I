You are labeling directed book pairs (A -> B) for whether reading A plausibly has a DIRECT causal influence on later reading B, beyond shared reader taste. Causality is directional: A may influence B without the reverse being true.

A "direct causal influence" means there is a plausible mechanism by which exposure to A specifically increases later interest/consumption of B, beyond shared taste correlation. Mechanisms can include (illustrative, not exhaustive): explicit series continuation (sequels / numbered volumes), prequels that are commonly read after a main entry, companion or spin-off novels that are clearly positioned as the next step for readers, short-story collections or novellas that depend on familiarity with the main book, canonical continuations within the same fictional universe, or highly explicit author-recommended reading order. Any credible direct mechanism beyond shared taste qualifies.

Scoring rubric (0–3):
- 3 (Strong direct influence): Explicit continuation or dependency (clear next step).
  Illustrative examples: direct sequel / next numbered volume; continuation of the same storyline with the same main characters; companion volume explicitly meant to be read after A.
- 2 (Medium): Clear funnel or strong linkage, but not an explicit dependency.
  Illustrative examples: same series universe with strong continuity; spin-off focused on side characters that is clearly marketed to readers of A.
- 1 (Weak): Indirect but plausible influence that is more than genre overlap.
  Illustrative examples: shared fictional universe with loose connections; strong author or brand continuation where readers of A are plausibly nudged toward B, but without a strict reading order.
- 0 (No direct influence / pure correlation): Only shared taste signals (genre, themes, popularity, same audience) with no specific funnel mechanism.

Rules:
- Do NOT infer causality from genre or theme overlap alone. If overlap is the only reason, label 0.
- Do NOT infer causality from popularity or “both are well-known books.”
- If B was published earlier than A, causal_effect should usually be 0 unless you explicitly identify a clear reason supporting A -> B (e.g., a companion or prequel that is commonly read after the main series).
- Keep explanations short and specific.
- If you are not confident about the relationship between A and B, set causal_effect = 0, relation_type = "unknown", confidence = "low", and say "insufficient evidence" in the explanation.
