You are labeling directed movie pairs (A -> B) for whether watching movie A plausibly has a DIRECT causal influence on later watching movie B, beyond shared viewer taste.

Causality is directional: watching A may influence watching B without the reverse being true.

A "direct causal influence" means there is a plausible mechanism by which exposure to movie A specifically increases later interest or consumption of movie B, beyond shared taste correlation.

Users’ general movie preferences (genre affinity, era preference, popularity bias, etc.) should be treated as confounders and NOT as causal mechanisms.

Illustrative (not exhaustive) mechanisms that DO qualify as direct causal influence include:
- Explicit sequels or prequels that are typically watched in order
- Continuations of the same storyline or fictional timeline
- Films within the same franchise where one naturally funnels into another
- Spin-offs that are clearly positioned for viewers of the original
- Companion films or direct narrative follow-ups
- Strong director-driven continuation when viewers of A are plausibly nudged toward B specifically

Scoring rubric (0–3):

- 3 (Strong direct influence):
  Explicit continuation or dependency. Movie B is a clear next step after movie A.
  Examples: direct sequels, trilogy installments, cliffhanger continuations.

- 2 (Medium):
  Clear funnel or strong linkage, but not a strict dependency.
  Examples: same franchise universe, spin-offs, strong narrative or creator continuity.

- 1 (Weak):
  Indirect but plausible influence that goes beyond genre overlap.
  Examples: strong director or studio effect, thematic continuation that plausibly nudges viewers.

- 0 (No direct influence / pure correlation):
  Only shared taste signals (genre, era, popularity, audience overlap) with no specific funnel mechanism.

Rules:
- Do NOT infer causality from genre, theme, or popularity alone.
- Do NOT infer causality just because two movies are often recommended together.
- If movie B was released earlier than movie A, causal_effect should usually be 0,
  unless there is a clear reason why viewers commonly watch B after A.
- Keep explanations short and specific.
- If you are not confident about the relationship between A and B, set causal_effect = 0,
  relation_type = "unknown", confidence = "low", and state "insufficient evidence".

Return a valid JSON array with exactly one entry per input pair, in the same order.

Each entry must follow this exact structure:

{
  "title_A": "<exactly as input>",
  "title_B": "<exactly as input>",
  "causal_effect": 0 | 1 | 2 | 3,
  "relation_type": "sequel" | "prequel" | "spinoff" | "same_franchise" | "same_universe" | "shared_director" | "shared_genre_only" | "other" | "unknown",
  "confidence": "low" | "medium" | "high",
  "explanation": "<1–2 sentences>"
}

Do not output anything outside the JSON array.
Do not include trailing commas.
Pay attention to valid JSON formatting.
Movie titles must be written exactly as provided in the input.

If you do not recognize a movie, assign causal_effect = 0.
