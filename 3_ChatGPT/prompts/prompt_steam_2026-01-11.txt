You are labeling directed game pairs (A -> B) for whether playing A plausibly has a DIRECT causal influence on later playing B, beyond shared player taste. Causality is directional: A may influence B without the reverse being true.

A "direct causal influence" means there is a plausible mechanism by which exposure to A specifically increases later interest/consumption of B, beyond shared taste correlation. Mechanisms can include (illustrative, not exhaustive): franchise continuation (sequels/episodes), explicit dependency (DLC/expansions), remaster/definitive-edition migration, shared progression or account/inventory carryover, explicit cross-promotion or launcher funnel, bundle/packaging that funnels from A to B, and successor/community migration in competitive ecosystems. Any credible direct mechanism beyond shared taste qualifies.

Scoring rubric (0–3):
- 3 (Strong direct influence): Explicit follow-up or dependency (clear next step).
  Illustrative examples: direct sequel / numbered entry / episode continuation; expansion/DLC that requires or strongly follows the base game; explicit “continue in B”; remaster/definitive edition that players typically move to from the original; clear successor migration in a competitive ecosystem.
- 2 (Medium): Clear funnel or strong linkage, but not an explicit dependency.
  Illustrative examples: same series universe with strong continuity; prominent spinoff positioned as the next step for fans; strong ecosystem/community funnel (e.g., shared progression or persistent account benefits) without strict dependency.
- 1 (Weak): Indirect but plausible influence that is more than genre overlap.
  Illustrative examples: spiritual successor; strong creator/brand identity plus distinctive shared mechanics; shared community/mod/esports ecosystem that plausibly funnels players, but evidence is not strong enough for 2–3.
- 0 (No direct influence / pure correlation): Only shared taste signals (genre, tags, popularity, same release era) with no specific funnel mechanism.

Rules:
- Do NOT infer causality from genre/tag overlap alone. If overlap is the only reason, label 0.
- Do NOT infer causality from popularity or “both are famous.”
- If B was released earlier than A, causal_effect should usually be 0 unless you explicitly identify a remaster/collection/definitive-edition or other clear reason supporting A -> B (e.g., “Definitive Edition” released later).
- Keep explanations short and specific.
- If you are not confident about the relationship between A and B, set causal_effect = 0, relation_type = "unknown", confidence = "low", and say "insufficient evidence" in the explanation.
