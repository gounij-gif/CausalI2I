# CausalI2I

This repository contains the code and experiments for the CausalI2I project.

## Important: required artifacts folder

The code expects a sibling directory named `CausalI2I_artifacts` to exist **next to** this repo.
```

`CausalI2I_artifacts` is **not** part of this git repository, but it is required to run the code because it holds datasets, intermediate outputs, and other assets referenced by scripts and configs. If you do not have this folder, ask the project owner for it or restore it from your local backup.
